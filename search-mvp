## 1️⃣ Must-Have Capabilities (Day-1)

These are **non-negotiable**.

---

### ✅ 1. Exact Product Search

**Supports queries like**

- “amul taaza milk”
- “surf excel”
- “dettol liquid”

**Business expectation**

- Exact product appears at the top
- Correct variants next
- Substitutes only if exact is unavailable

📌 If this fails, users churn immediately.

---

### ✅ 2. Brand Search

**Supports queries like**

- “amul”
- “nestle”
- “himalaya”

**Business expectation**

- Show top-selling SKUs of that brand
- Mix categories
- Avoid obscure variants early

📌 This increases basket size naturally.

---

### ✅ 3. Category Search

**Supports queries like**

- “chips”
- “biscuits”
- “soap”
- “vegetables”

**Business expectation**

- Popular items first
- Limited, curated results
- No overwhelming lists

📌 Category search = controlled discovery.

---

### ✅ 4. In-Stock Only Results (Critical)

**Business rule**

- Never show unavailable products
- Never let users discover stock issues after clicking

📌 Availability > relevance > price.

---

### ✅ 5. Store / Location Awareness

**Business rule**

- Results must reflect the user’s assigned dark store
- Search is local, not global

📌 Same query may return different results by location.
Note : even though we are starting with 1 dark store we need to build the system in a way that we can incorporate multiple dark stores without having to do too much design changes in future.

---

### ✅ 6. Misspellings & Synonyms

**Supports**

- Typos (`amul tazza`)
- Variants (`aata` vs `atta`)
- Brand-as-category (`surf`, `colgate`)

📌 Search must speak **user language**.

---

### ✅ 7. Zero “No Results” Pages

**Business expectation**

- Always return something useful
- Show substitutes or category fallback

📌 Empty search = lost order.

---

## 2️⃣ Must-Have Ranking Logic (Very Simple)

Search MVP ranking should be **rule-based**, not smart.

Priority order:

1. In-stock
2. Popular / fast-moving
3. Common pack sizes
4. Trusted brands
5. Price (only as a tie-breaker)

📌 No AI. No personalization.

---

## 3️⃣ UX Expectations for Search MVP

Search results must:

- Load fast
- Be stable
- Be predictable

Each result should clearly show:

- Product image
- Name
- Size
- Price
- Add button

📌 User should add without opening PDP.

---

## 4️⃣ MVP Metrics (Day-1 Tracking)

Search MVP must track:

- Search → Add-to-Cart %
- Zero-result search rate
- Time to first add-to-cart
- Search usage per session

📌 If these are healthy, MVP is working.

---

## 5️⃣ Explicitly NOT in Search MVP

This is **critical for scope control**.

❌ Personalization

❌ AI intent detection

❌ Advanced filters

❌ Voice search

❌ Recommendations inside search

❌ Sponsored search results

❌ Margin-based ranking

> These are Phase-2 / Phase-3 features.
>

## 6️⃣ Search MVP Success Definition

Search MVP is successful if:

- Users consistently find essentials in seconds
- Add-to-cart happens quickly
- Zero-result searches are rare
- Users trust search results

> Boring but reliable = success
